## üß† How it works

- The assistant **analyzes conversation**:
  - If the user message suggests wanting an expense prediction, it fetches past transactions, runs Prophet, and returns forecast.
  - Otherwise, the assistant generates a fun reply (small talk, jokes, trivia, etc.) using GPT-4.
- All logic is in `app/services/assistant.py`
